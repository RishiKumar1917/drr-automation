Scripted DRR tracker with intern sheets and admin dashboard on Google Sheets.

What I Did
To ensure data integrity, I collected the interns’ personal Gmail IDs. This makes sure that only they can access and edit their own DRR (Daily Reflection Report).

I created two Google Spreadsheets:

Admin Sheet – gives an overview and easy access to all intern progress.

Intern Sheet – individual access for interns to fill their DRR daily.

For a better user experience, I made a separate table for each intern.
To maintain structure, headings are non-editable — interns can only write in the specified columns.
